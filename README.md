# 🌏📗 GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS-Week-4 🗾
# 🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 4, we explored different types of high-resolution georeferenced images that are essential in the field of drone-based remote sensing and GIS analysis. These advanced image types—unlike regular images—are geo-tagged or geo-referenced, meaning they contain precise location data. This geospatial information allows for accurate identification of resources, terrain modeling, and integration into mapping software like QGIS.

Understanding these image formats is critical for the development of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), which are foundational in resource mapping, infrastructure planning, environmental monitoring, and machine learning applications.

# 🎯 Objective
- To learn about various high-resolution drone imagery formats used in GIS.
- To understand the difference between regular images and georeferenced (geo-tagged) images.
- To study the application of:
  - Orthomosaic
  - True Ortho
  - Dynamic Ortho
-To understand how these images contribute to building accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).
- To prepare for terrain-based resource identification and ML model training.

# ✨ Key Features
- Learning the structure and utility of:
  - 📷 Orthomosaic Images – stitched, geometrically corrected aerial images.
  - 📷 True Ortho Images – distortion-free, vertically corrected images, ideal for urban structures.
  - 📷 Dynamic Ortho Images – time-based orthophotos to monitor environmental or infrastructure changes.
- Understanding the importance of geo-referenced imagery in GIS projects.
- Foundation for creating 3D elevation models from drone imagery.
- Preparation for automated analysis using machine learning.

# 🛠️ Project Steps
- Explored sample datasets of high-resolution drone imagery.
- Identified differences between Orthomosaic, True Ortho, and Dynamic Ortho images.
- Learned how these image types are georeferenced, containing metadata for real-world coordinates.
- Understood how these images are used to generate Digital Terrain Models (DTM) in QGIS.
- Prepared terrain layers for future integration into ML pipelines.
